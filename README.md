node-mongo-blog
===

Testing ground for node.js api with mongodb. This is as simple blog site that will be extended and modified for the MyTestimony project I'm working on.


#Usage

1. install dependencies and libraries `$ npm install`
2. Fire up Mongo DB `$ mongod`
3. Run node app `$ node app.js`


## Todo

* Load  and test onto heroku server
* Include API for another client to consume: website, mobile app
     * will return JSON
* Look into build server, continuous integration architecture to automatically run build deployment upon git push
